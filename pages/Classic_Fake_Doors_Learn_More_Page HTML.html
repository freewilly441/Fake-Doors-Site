        <p>Step into the world of timeless design with our Classic Fake Door. It looks like a door but leads nowhere!</p>
        <p><strong>The D'Amico Legacy:</strong> Joey comes from a long line of "entrepreneurs" with a penchant for shady business ideas. His great-grandfather, Sal "The Handle Guy" D'Amico, was famous for selling doorknobs that came without screws. His uncle Tony tried to market "invisible fences" for goldfish, and his cousin Gina launched a line of "windowless windows" that were just picture frames. Joey took the family tradition to the next level with Fake Doors Co., proving that no idea is too ridiculous if you sell it with confidence!</p>
